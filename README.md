# notes
This is an exremely basic React Native application with a backend in Node js that allows a user to create an account, login to said account, create a note and read all created notes.

This is not a useful application in any sort of way, just a way for me to confirm for myself and others that I have a basic understanding of backend and frontend development, including authorization and databases with SQL. In this case PostgresSQL.

There are som hard coded ip addresses and it requires a local PostgresSQL server.
