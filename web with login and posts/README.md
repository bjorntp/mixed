## Web app

This is a fairly basic web application which supports user creation and authentication using JWT. Also allows users to make a post that is visible on the front page. 

Frontend created in both react and react native, backend is in node js with a PostgreSQL database.

The application does not have a real use, it only created so I can try implementing different things.
